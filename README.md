## About

In this application, I have an appointment app for a Psychologist's office. The user can choose from a list of 
consultancies and choose a date and time to make an appointment with the Psychologist at that time. the user has the admin privelege he can also create a new Consultancy area and see a list of all appointments made. The user logs in and signs up to the application using Json Web Token.

To build this application I used:

- Javascript ES6;
- Html/CSS;
- React;
- Redux;
- React-Redux;
- Jest;
- Create React App;
- React Hooks;
- React Router
- Linters ( eslint and stylelint)
